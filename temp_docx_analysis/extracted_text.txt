
The Autopsy: How to Read the Mind of a Polymarket WhaleHYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/thejayden"HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/thejayden"Jayden HYPERLINK "https://twitter.com/thejayden"@thejayden·2월 10일·In my last post, I gave you the code to pull the raw trading data of any wallet on Polymarket. But data without context is just noise. Before we move on, JOIN HERE.Today, we are going to learn how to read the output of the Trade Autopsy Tool. We are going to dissect a real log (from the script I shared) to show you how to spot:Fake Gurus (High PnL, but terrible entry).Bots (Inhuman trading speed).The "Holy Grail" (Risk-free arbitrage).If you are copying trades without checking these metrics, you are flying blind. Here is how to open your eyes.1. The "Time Profitable" Metric: The Truth SerumMost traders only care about the final result: "Did they make money? "Real analysts ask: "How much pain did they endure to get there?"Look at this section from the tool's output:plaintext⏱️ PROFITABILITY TIMELINE ANALYSISTotal Trading Period:     0.66 hoursTime Profitable:          33.87% (0.22 hours)Time Unprofitable:        66.13% (0.43 hours)What this tells you: This trader was underwater for 66% of the trade. They spent twice as much time losing as they did winning.The Lesson: If you copy-traded this wallet, you would have been staring at red numbers for most of the hour. You need "diamond hands" to follow them.The Alpha: Look for traders with &gt;80% Time Profitable. These are the "Snipers." Their entry timing is so perfect that they go green immediately and stay green. That is who you want to copy.2. The Hedge Check: Finding Free MoneyThis is the most critical metric in the entire script. It tells you if the trader is gambling or printing cash.plaintext📊 CURRENT STATUSCurrent YES Avg Price:    $0.7485Current NO Avg Price:     $0.2515Combined Avg (YES+NO):    $1.0000Current Profitability:    ❌ NOT PROFITABLEThe Math:In a binary market, YES + NO always settles at $1.00.If a trader's Combined Avg is $1.00, they are neutral. They have zero edge.If the Combined Avg is $0.95, they have locked in a 5% risk-free profit. It doesn't matter who wins; they paid 95 cents for a dollar bill.The Strategy:Run this script on the top 10 holders of a market. If you find someone with a Combined Avg &lt; $1.00, stop everything. Analyze when they bought. You just found an arbitrage opportunity.3. Behavioral Forensics: Bot vs. HumanHow do you know if you are competing against a person or an algorithm? The tool tells you instantly.plaintext🎯 TRADING BEHAVIORTrading Intensity:        HIGH (avg 0.0 min between trades)Interpretation:           Very active trader, making rapid decisions0.0 minutes between trades.Nohuman can click that fast. This is a bot.Why this matters: Do not try to "race" this trader. They will front-run you. If you see this pattern, you need to beat them on strategy, not speed.4. The "Accumulation" SignalDid they panic buy? Or did they slowly build a position like a pro?plaintext🔍 TRADING PATTERN INSIGHTS- YES Accumulation:    INCREASING (late trades 1.6x larger)- YES Price Trend:     CHASING HIGHERAccumulation INCREASING: They started small (testing the water) and bet bigger as they got confident. This is a sign of a disciplined trader.Price Trend CHASING HIGHER: This is a warning sign. It means they were FOMOing (Fear Of Missing Out). They kept buying even as the price got worse.📊 Tutorial: How to Run The AutopsyYou have the 3 scripts fetch_trades.py - https://pastebin.com/4zRS0PYbanalyze_trades.py - https://pastebin.com/DA2DpwBdanalyze_user.py - https://pastebin.com/BRAr09aTHere is the 30-second guide to using them.Step 1: Install DependenciesYou only need one library. Open your terminal and run:pip3 install requestsStep 2: Find Your TargetGo to Polymarket. Click on a leaderboard or a specific market. Copy two things:The Market Name (e.g., "Bitcoin Up or Down February 6").The Wallet Address of the trader (e.g., 0x6031...).Step 3: Run The CommandOpen your terminal in the folder where you saved the scripts. Run this single command:pythonpython3 analyze_user.py "Bitcoin Up or Down February 6" 0x6031b6eed1c97e853c6e0f03ad3ce3529351f96dStep 4: Read the OutputThe script will:Search Polymarket for that event.Download every single trade that wallet made.Print the full forensic report we discussed above.Pro Tip:Want to save the data to analyze later? Add a filename at the end:pythonpython3 analyze_user.py "Market Name" 0xAddress my_analysis.jsonUse the tools. Stop guessing.
