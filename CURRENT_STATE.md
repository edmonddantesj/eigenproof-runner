## 📍 Current Position: OPUS Build Phase (Mid-tier)
8-agent individual skill boilerplates and core infrastructure (Guardian, Core-Temp) have been successfully built using Flash. The squad is now ready for high-level logic implementation (V6 Rebuilding, Layer 3 Security) using the Gemini 3 Pro (OPUS) engine.

## 🏁 Milestones & Results

### 1. 🏗️ Infrastructure & 9-Agent Squad
- [x] **9-Agent Skill Boilerplates**: All agents (Sound, Eye, Blade, Brain, Flash, Record, Oracle, Gear, Med) have functional scripts with S-DNA Layer 1-2.
- [x] **🛡️ Guardian Tier 1-2**: `guardian_sentry_v1.py` deployed (Regex-based security scan).
- [x] **🌡️ Core-Temp Engine**: `core_temp_engine.py` deployed (Current Score: 95.6/Optimal).
- [x] **🗂️ Session Immortal**: `state_integrity.py` integrated into saving protocol.

### 2. 🤖 Engine & Strategy
- [x] **OpenClaw Engine Update**: v2026.2.12 successfully deployed.
- [x] **ClawHub Intelligence**: 3 high-value trading/learning skills discovered for V6 fusion.
- [x] **$AOI Stealth Strategy**: 4-tier exposure control protocol verified.

## 📝 TODO List (Immediate)
1. **[L2/Oracle] Alpha Oracle V6 Rebuilding**: Porting Bayesian Fusion & Self-Learning logic from ClawHub findings to Aoineco Edition.
2. **[L2/Blade] S-DNA Layer 3 Handshake**: Designing runtime encrypted handshake between agents.
3. **[L1/Oracle] ACP Tech Whitepaper**: Finalizing technical documentation for hackathon submission.
4. **[L1/Gear] Browser Control Service Fix**: Resolving "No tab connected" issue to enable Pro-subscription hybrid use.

## ⚠️ Active Blockers
- **Browser Relay**: Still disconnected. Required for "ChatGPT Pro" hybrid scraping strategy.

## 📊 Resource Status
- **Context Usage**: 11% (Optimal)
- **Engine**: Gemini 3 Flash (Ready to switch to Pro/OPUS for next phase)
- **State Security**: ALL CLEAR (Verified by State-Guardian)
