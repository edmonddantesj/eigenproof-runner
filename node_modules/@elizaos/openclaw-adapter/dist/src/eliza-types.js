/**
 * Eliza type definitions needed by the adapter.
 *
 * These are the minimal type contracts from @elizaos/core that the adapter
 * depends on. Defining them locally avoids cross-workspace dependency
 * resolution issues while keeping full type safety.
 *
 * These types mirror the corresponding types in eliza/packages/typescript/src/types/.
 * When an actual @elizaos/core package is available at runtime (because the
 * user has installed the Eliza plugins), the runtime objects will satisfy these
 * interfaces because they implement the same contracts.
