/**
 * Eliza Plugin Adapter for OpenClaw.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS & LIMITATIONS:
 * - Eliza plugins must be importable from this context (npm-installed or path-resolvable)
 * - eliza-types.ts manually mirrors @elizaos/core types — must be updated when Eliza core changes
 * - InMemoryStore is ephemeral with no persistence and no eviction (unbounded growth)
 * - Services are started eagerly during register(), not deferred to OpenClaw lifecycle
 * - LLM methods (useModel, generateText) throw NotImplementedError — actions needing LLM extraction won't work
 * - Connector plugins (Discord, Telegram) register as tools only, not as OpenClaw channels
 * - Database adapter plugins are not bridged — the InMemoryStore is the only database
 * - One RuntimeBridge per adapter registration — no multi-tenant support
