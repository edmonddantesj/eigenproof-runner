 * Retrieves all addresses and their balances associated with an extended public key (xPub).
 *
 * An extended public key (xPub) is a Bitcoin public key that can be used to derive multiple
 * child addresses. This action fetches all derived addresses along with their individual balances
 * and the total balance across all addresses.
 *
 * @param client - Client instance configured with UTXO transport
 * @param params - {@link GetXPubAddressesParameters}
 * @returns The xPub account data including total balance and all derived addresses. {@link GetXPubAddressesReturnType}
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const result = await getXPubAddresses(client, {
 *   xPubKey: 'xpub6CcGTthbwnbxsMRuEF3sb...'
 * })
 *
 * console.log(result.balance) // Total balance across all addresses
 * console.log(result.addresses) // Array of derived addresses with individual balances
 * ```
