here's how to reverse engineer solscan public website to access the private data API they sell for $200/mo to their users - you'll see how you can build custom scraper that bypass a lot of platform's security measures
DISCLAIMER: all of the content is meant for educational purpose only. Using their API this way directly violate Solscan TOS.
For those who don’t know, this is what solscan looks like:



main block explorer for Solana. you can look up any transaction, any account, any token - all on-chain data in one place. super useful if you're building ai trading agents or anything that needs to react to on-chain activity
they make money by selling API access to all this data. cheapest plan starts at $200/mo



i figured there had to be a way to pull data directly from their site. but i also assumed they'd have it locked down tight - if your whole business model is selling data access, you'd protect the pipeline, right?
wrong
opening dev tools



opened the Network tab while the page loaded. immediately saw a bunch of XMLHttpRequest calls pulling all the transaction data client-side
this was a HUGE RED FLAG. sites that sell data access almost always use server-side rendering so the browser only gets static HTML - no exposed endpoints, no internal API calls to intercept
solscan just... didn't do that. the endpoints loading the data on the website are the same ones in their paid API docs. literally identical



Official API Documentation
the "authentication"
every request has a header called sol-aut with what looks like a random string. each request uses a different one - reusing a token gets rejected
so i dug into the JS that generates the request. found the file _app-0387a288f339cc14.js, searched for "sol_aut" expecting obfuscated code
NOPE. plaintext. the function is called generateRandomString() and it does exactly what you'd expect:



it generates a 40-char random string from that character set, then inserts "B9dls0fK" at a random position. that's it. that's the entire auth layer for a $200/mo product
testing it
wrote a quick Python script to replicate the token generation and hit the API:



response comes back clean:



unlimited access. no API key. $0/mo.
the actual problem here
this obviously violates their TOS and probably won't last forever. but that's not the point
the point is they're charging $200/mo for something they didn't even bother to protect. no TLS fingerprint rejection. no rate limiting. the auth token is a random string generated client-side with the logic sitting in unobfuscated JS
i genuinely think they should fix this. it's bad practice for a company that built otherwise solid software
the takeaway
web scraping is 80% reverse engineering. open the network tab, spend time dissecting how the requests actually work, and sometimes you find stuff like this where the entire paid layer is held together by a random string function in plaintext JS
i packaged this into a Python library - you can grab it from the 
GitHub repo
and install it directly NOTE: I originally wrote this article for my blog back in March 2025 - 1 year ago. since then they ACTUALLY implemented a little more security measures. they added some Cloudflare protection directly to the API endpoint, but spoiler: i've updated the code to use Cloudscraper a python library that let you send requests that can 80% the times easily bypass cloudflare protection. its works. the rate limits might be different tho.
