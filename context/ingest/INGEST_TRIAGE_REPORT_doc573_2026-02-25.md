## 1) Classification
- Type: Security bypass / ToS circumvention write-up (Solscan premium API reverse engineering)

## 2) Value score (0–3)
- Score: **0 (do not use / do not internalize)**

## 3) Decision
- **Triage stop**. Do not produce operational summary or reproduction steps.

## 4) Rationale
- Contains instructions aimed at bypassing paid access controls and potentially Cloudflare protections.
- Explicitly states ToS violation; high legal/compliance risk.
- Not suitable for AOI Core adoption or public documentation.

## 5) Safe takeaway (allowed)
- General reminder only: use official APIs or obtain permission; do not build business workflows on ToS circumvention.
