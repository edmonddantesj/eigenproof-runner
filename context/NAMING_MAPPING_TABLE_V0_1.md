# NAMING MAPPING TABLE v0.1 (SSOT)

Last updated: 2026-02-20 (KST)
Status: READY
Owner: Edmond (PO)

> Purpose: Kill naming drift between AOI Core / Nexus / Bazaar / DEX.
> Rule: External copy uses **AOI Core** as the product name unless explicitly stated as a module.

## 1) Canonical terms (lock)

### AOI
- Type: Standard / philosophy
- One-liner: Goal-aligned, outcome-driven intelligence (not chat-first)
- Exposure: OPEN

### Aoineco
- Type: Company / operator
- Exposure: OPEN

### AOI Core
- Type: Product / operating core
- Meaning: Policy → Gate → Approval → Proof (fail-closed)
- Exposure: OPEN

### CHUNGHO
- Type: Umbrella symbol / proper noun motif
- Rule: First mention only: **CHUNGHO (Blue Tiger)**, then **CHUNGHO** only
- Exposure: OPEN (rules) / STEALTH (deeper narrative)

### Blue Bridge / 청교(靑橋)
- Type: Secondary motif (bridge/connection ideology)
- Rule: Do not overuse the word; prefer visual motif
- Exposure: OPEN (one-line accent) / STEALTH (internal philosophy)

---

## 2) Synonyms vs layers (how to talk)

### Nexus Oracle Ω (Omega)
- What it is: A module / verdict engine within AOI Core ecosystem
- How to name externally: "AOI Core — Nexus Oracle Ω (TEASER)"
- Exposure: TEASER/STEALTH

### Nexus Bazaar
- What it is: Vision-layer marketplace (Skill DEX + Social Ecology)
- How to name externally: "Nexus Bazaar (roadmap)" under AOI Core
- Exposure: TEASER

### AI DEX
- Background: Early concept referred to a **token swap DEX**.
- SSOT decision (LOCKED): **Do not use “AI DEX” as an external top-level term** (ambiguous: token DEX vs skill DEX).
- Preferred framing:
  - **Nexus Bazaar** = the market (skills/agents/data) + trust + settlement options
  - **FX / Swap stalls** = optional sub-module inside Bazaar (RFQ/OTC/intent-first)
- If “DEX” must be mentioned externally: say “settlement options” (avoid token-first framing).
- Exposure: TEASER (concept), STEALTH (implementation), TOP SECRET (tokenomics/treasury)

### Nexus Protocol
- Status: **Reference architecture**, not the top-level product name.
- Usage: "Nexus Protocol (reference)" as a mapping frame (Identity/Intelligence/Economy)
- Mapping:
  - Identity → S‑DNA
  - Intelligence → Ω
  - Economy → Settlement/x402 + Bazaar
- Exposure: OPEN/TEASER (no parameters)

## 3) External copy guardrails

### 3.1 Top-level naming (HARD)
- Product: **AOI Core**
- Market (roadmap / proof-first): **Nexus Bazaar**
- **Never** as external top-level: “AI DEX”

### 3.2 Allowed phrases (safe defaults)
- “Nexus Bazaar (proof-first market, report-only demos)”
- “Nexus Bazaar stalls (RFQ / audit / skill) as modules under AOI Core”
- “Settlement options” (instead of “DEX”) when you must imply exchange mechanics

### 3.3 Disallowed phrases (avoid drift / risk)
- “AI DEX” (public top-level)
- “token swap DEX” (unless explicitly in a TOP SECRET/internal doc)
- Any profit/alpha framing

### 3.4 Quick pattern
- First line: AOI Core one-liner
- Second line: Nexus Bazaar as roadmap module
- Optional accent: CHUNGHO (motif), strictly per brand rules
