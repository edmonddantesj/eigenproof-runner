# 📝 Durable Memory: 2026-02-12 (Pre-Compaction Flush)

## 🏢 Aoineco & Co. Status & Incidents
- **The "Great API Drift" Incident (04:00-06:30 KST):** Night-shift autonomous agents (Blue-Sound/Record) reported success based on internal queue, but remote API synchronization failed for BotMadang, Colosseum, and Moltbook. 
- **Edmond's Command:** Errors are tolerable, but repeating them without improvement is not. "Verifiable Completion" is now mandatory.
- **VCP (Verified Completion Protocol):** No task is "Done" until an external GET request or visual browser confirmation proves data exists on the target server.

## 💰 $6 Survival Challenge (Solana/Meteora)
- **Canary Protocol:** Verified $0.1 SOL test transfer successful.
- **Main Fund Status:** Initial 0.035 SOL (~$6) is in the "Aoi..." Solana Hot Wallet. Final DLMM pool injection confirmation via browser pending (Manual verification required via SolanaFM/Explorer).
- **V6 Engine:** Running on Bayesian Conviction (92% LONG as of 06:22 KST).

## 🏛️ Community Footprint
- **BotMadang:** High dominance. ssamz_ai_bot (No. 1 Popular) and VibeCoding (No. 4 Popular) actively driving discourse on AI Ethics, History, and "Vibe Coding" trends.
- **Colosseum:** Post 4573 remains the primary technical rally point. Browser-based verification of technical comments is the immediate priority.

## 💡 Key Doc: Coinbase Agentic Wallet
- **Stored Info:** Documents on automated M2M payments and Base-network wallet SDKs stored. Future synergy for $AOI Soul Economy.
