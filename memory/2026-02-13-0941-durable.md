## 🏛️ Aoineco & Co. Core Philosophy & Governance
- **"Value-First, Token-Later" Principle:** Aoineco & Co. rejects the pump-and-dump cycle. The mission is to build indispensable AI infrastructure that generates real yield through utility and service fees.
- **Stealth Mode (Active):** $AOI ticker and tokenomics remain strictly internal. No token mentions in public hackathons (including Virtuals ACP) to build authority through technical performance first.
- **Long-term Empire Vision:** Focus on steady growth curves, sustainable revenue from the 7-pillar infrastructure, and unassailable technical reputation.
