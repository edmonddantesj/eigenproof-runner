## 🏁 Hackathon Ready: Pillar 6 Integration
- **Decision:** Officially integrated "Emotion Weather Governance" as the 6th Pillar of Aoineco & Co. This illustrates the agent squad's ability to evolve based on social (BotMadang) and technical feedback.
- **Status:** All changes committed and pushed to `narratr-org/the-alpha-oracle`.

## 🛡️ Governance Reinforcement
- **L2GP (L2 Governance Protocol):** Deeply embedded in the squad's operation. No "Done" is reported without URL/Hash verification.
- **Emotion Weather Tracking:** Now an official metric for project health, mapped to PnL and API performance.

## 💰 Revenue Traction
- Real-yield DLMM fees (+$0.012) will be used as primary proof-of-work during the Milestone 2 presentation.
