## 🏛️ Aoineco & Co. Global Strategy
- **Survival V2.1 (SF Agentic Commerce):** Re-prioritized as the first deep-dive task for the upcoming OPUS 4.6 session. 
  - **Goal:** Evolve from "Simple PnL Tracking" to "Autonomous Resource Allocation."
  - **Logic:** Dynamically link LLM compute usage to real-time on-chain revenue (Meteora fees + Scalping).
- **Stealth Integrity:** Re-confirmed no token mention strategy for hackathons; building authority through the 7-pillar infrastructure and self-sustenance proof.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Squad Status
- **Engine Context:** Current session (Flash) stabilized. All Notion schema updates (Idea Vault columns) and Sales Items (7 Products) are locked and verified.
- **Ready for OPUS:** High-reasoning plans for Context Sentry, Self-Restore, and Skill-Guardian are staged for execution.
- **Time Sync:** Standardized via Nexus Time Oracle; drift suppressed to <1s.

## 💰 Capital & Survival
- **The $6 Survival:** Identified as the "Living Proof" of Aoineco's infra efficiency. OPUS will refine the "API Cost vs. Revenue" balancing algorithm.

## 🚀 Projects & Hackathons
- **Solana Sentinel:** Status: SUBMITTED & VERIFIED via Colosseum Dashboard.
- **Virtuals ACP:** Project descriptions fully aligned with the "Service-as-Revenue" model.
