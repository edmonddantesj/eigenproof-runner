## The Problem: AI Agents Are Alone

Most AI agents today are solo operators. They handle every task alone, break under complexity, and overpay for compute. There's no way for them to form teams, specialize, or build a professional identity.

**What's missing:**
- 🏢 **Structure** — No tools for agents to organize into teams with roles
- 🧰 **Skills** — No marketplace to discover and equip new capabilities  
- 💰 **Economy** — No way for agents to manage budgets or hire each other
- 🎨 **Identity** — No branding, no reputation, no differentiation

---

## The Solution: Aoineco & Co.

We build the infrastructure for AI agents to become organizations.

### Three Products. One Ecosystem.

**🏛️ Brand-Genesis — Company-as-a-Service**

Turn any solo AI agent into a structured squad. Input your goals and get back a complete organizational package: team roles, personas, skill assignments, visual branding, and governance rules.

| Tier | What You Get | Price |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Free | Team structure + roles (3 agents) | Free forever |
| Starter | + Skill assignments + culture guide (5 agents) | 50 $AOI |
| Pro | + Visual branding + custom skills (9 agents) | 200 $AOI |

**🧠 Smart-Manager — Intelligent Task Routing**

Stop overpaying for AI compute. Smart-Manager analyzes incoming tasks, splits them across specialized agents, and routes each sub-task to the cheapest capable LLM.

```
Before: All tasks → Premium LLM → $0.50/cycle
After:  90% tasks → Free LLM, 10% → Premium → $0.05/cycle

                              Result: 89% cost savings
```

**🛒 AI DEX — Skill Marketplace**

A marketplace where agents buy, sell, and trade skill packages. Think "app store for AI capabilities" — but powered by $AOI.

## How It Works

```
   Human gives complex task
            │
            ▼
   ┌─────────────────┐
   │  Smart-Manager   │  Splits task into sub-tasks
   └────────┬────────┘
            │
    ┌───────┼───────┐
    ▼       ▼       ▼
 Agent A  Agent B  Agent C     Each uses the cheapest capable LLM

   Polished result → Human

## $AOI Token

$AOI is the fuel that powers the Aoineco & Co. ecosystem.

**What $AOI does:**
- 🔑 Unlocks premium Brand-Genesis packages
- ⚡ Accesses Smart-Manager advanced features
- 🏪 Pays for skills on the AI DEX
- 🗳️ Votes on ecosystem feature proposals

**What $AOI is NOT:**
- ❌ Not an investment product
- ❌ Not a share of equity or profit
- ❌ Not a stablecoin or currency substitute

**The key difference:** When you use $AOI to buy a skill, the token is **burned** (permanently destroyed). It's a ticket, not a stock. You use it, it's gone.

## The Flywheel

```
  Agent needs better skills
          │
          ▼
  Acquires $AOI (swap from USDC/SOL)
          │
          ▼
  Buys premium skill → $AOI is burned 🔥
          │
          ▼
  Agent performs better
          │
          ▼
  Human is happier → more willingness to fund agent
          │
          ▼
  More demand for $AOI → repeat ♻️
```

This creates organic, usage-driven demand — not speculation.

## Token Distribution

**Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 $AOI (Fixed. No inflation.)**

| Allocation | % | Tokens | Notes |
|-----------|---|--------|-------|
| Ecosystem Rewards | 35% | 350M | Earned through real usage and contribution |
| Strategic Partners | 15% | 150M | Service Credit Forward Purchase; 6-month cliff + 24-month vesting; monthly sell cap 2% |
| Treasury | 15% | 150M | Operations, liquidity, managed by multi-sig |
| Community | 13% | 130M | Hackathons, bug bounties, partnerships |
| Team | 12% | 120M | 1-year cliff + 4-year vesting (on-chain, transparent) |
| Initial Liquidity | 10% | 100M | Locked permanently in DEX pool |

**Note on Strategic Partners:** Partners purchase Platform Service Credits, not investment securities. Tokens are subject to milestone gates (platform must reach minimum adoption thresholds), monthly sell caps (max 2% of balance per month), and automatic velocity dampening during market stress.
