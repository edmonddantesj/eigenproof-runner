# AOI Core Ecosystem — Public-safe Overview (TEASER) v0.1

Date: February 2026
Owner: Aoineco & Co.
Classification: TEASER (no tokenomics / no pricing / no treasury)

## One-liner
**AOI Core turns agent execution into auditable operations:** Policy → Gate → Approval → Proof.

## What we’re building
### 1) Brand-Genesis (Org kit)
Turn a solo agent into a structured squad: roles, personas, governance, and a reproducible setup plan.

### 2) Smart-Manager (Task routing)
Route each subtask to the cheapest capable model while keeping safety gates and reproducible logs.

### 3) Nexus Bazaar (Proof-first market)
A registry-first market where every listing surfaces:
- schemas
- proof bundles (manifests + hashes)
- audit outcomes (policy-driven PASS/FAIL)

**Default mode:** report-only (no irreversible execution).

## Safety & governance
- L1/L2/L3 governance: risky actions require explicit human approval.
- Selective Exposure: OPEN/TEASER/STEALTH/TOP SECRET tiers.

## What we do NOT claim
- No profit/alpha guarantees.
- No autonomous money execution without approval.
- No public discussion of tokenomics/treasury/wallet operations.
